PROBLEM STATEMENT:
As with most online applications, there is no proper application or website for the students to find study materials especially hard copy of books. 
Students have to search a lot on the web to get complete study materials. 
Even though there are so much softcopy content available on the web , there is a need for students to avail book according to their curriculum. 

ABSTRACT:
In proposed model, alumnus will mention details of textbooks and students will be able to view and avail them for particular time limit. 
Once if the limit gets over, students need to return the textbooks to the alumni. 
If any textbook gets damaged , then that particular student need to pay a penalty charge to the college which must reach the alumni through librarian.
Communication will be done through mail ID provided.
